# Notes from Java

This is the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGTx91t8q50&list=PLYgUZw9kWF5GJm6775_yvYfgezjt72ZWv&index=27&t=2146s) I used to learn the basics of java.

- Java is a static language because the entire code has to written, once it is written then it has to be compiled and after that it can be executed.

- Every machine that has java installed has **JVM** that is _Java Virtual Machine_ because of this all the java files can run on any device regardless of the operating system.

- In order for _JVM_ to function it needs hardware and OS for sure, the code needs to be converted to _bytecode_. Java comes in huge set of files but JVM only executes only one file and that is **main** file so for it execute it, `public static void main` can be used to access the files.

- string and system must always start with capital letter, they must look like `String` and `System`.

```
// First piece of java code
public class hello // class and file name must be same
{
    public static void main(String a[])
    {
        System.out.println("First line");
    }
}
```

- To run this program we need to hit `javac hello.java` on the terminal and `java hello`.
